UnixBench Benchmark

This repository contains the setup and runtime configurations for the UnixBench 
benchmark. UnixBench is the original BYTE UNIX benchmark suite, updated and 
revised by many people over the years. The purpose of UnixBench is to provide a 
basic indicator of the performance of a Unix-like system; hence, multiple tests 
are used to test various aspects of the system's performance. These test 
results are then compared to the scores from a baseline system to produce an 
index value, which is generally easier to handle than the raw scores. The 
entire set of index values is then combined to make an overall index for the 
system. For more information, review the project website:

RUNTIME PARAMETERS
None


RESULT METRICS
multicore_copies          The number of UnixBench copies used to produce the 
                          multicore_score metric
                          
multicore_score           UnixBench multiple copy/multicore score (produced for 
                          compute instances with > 1 core)

score                     UnixBench single copy score. This metric is always 
                          produced

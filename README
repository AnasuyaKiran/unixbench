UnixBench Benchmark

This repository contains the setup and runtime configurations for the UnixBench 
benchmark. UnixBench is the original BYTE UNIX benchmark suite, updated and 
revised by many people over the years. The purpose of UnixBench is to provide a 
basic indicator of the performance of a Unix-like system; hence, multiple tests 
are used to test various aspects of the system's performance. These test 
results are then compared to the scores from a baseline system to produce an 
index value, which is generally easier to handle than the raw scores. The 
entire set of index values is then combined to make an overall index for the 
system. For more information, review the project website:

https://code.google.com/p/byte-unixbench/

You may download the source there or from our S3 bucket here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudbench/software/UnixBench5.1.3.tgz

To install UnixBench:
tar zxf UnixBench5.1.3.tgz
cd UnixBench
make all

NOTE: this benchmark clears the UnixBench/results directory during and 
following each test iteration. Any existing results will be removed


TESTING PARAMETERS
Testing behavior is mostly fixed - with the exception of selecting individual 
tests and copies for multi-core testing. You may also specify optional meta 
attributes and installation attributes. The meta attributes will be included in 
the results (see save.sh). UnixBench should be installed and compiled before 
running this benchmark. Review the 'unixbench_dir' parameter comments below for 
instructions.

* collectd_rrd              If set, collectd rrd stats will be captured from 
                            --collectd_rrd_dir. To do so, when testing starts,
                            existing directories in --collectd_rrd_dir will 
                            be renamed to .bak, and upon test completion 
                            any directories not ending in .bak will be zipped
                            and saved along with other test artifacts (as 
                            collectd-rrd.zip). User MUST have sudo privileges
                            to use this option

                            default is /var/lib/collectd/rrd

* meta_burst                If set to 1, designates testing performed in burst

* unixbench_dir             Directory where UnixBench is installed. If not 
                            specified, the benchmark run script will look up 
                            the directory tree from both pwd and --output for 
                            presence of a 'UnixBench' directory with an 
                            executable 'Run' script in it
